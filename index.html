                            On March 8, 2016, Morris was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete on season 22 of Dancing with the Stars.
                             He was partnered with professional dancer Lindsay Arnold.[8] Morris and Arnold made it to the semifinals of the show,
                              but were then eliminated and finished the competition 
                            in fourth place overall, despite having the highest accumulative average at the time of their elimination.
